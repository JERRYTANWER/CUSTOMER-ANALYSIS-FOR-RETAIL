**Retail Customer Analysis - Case Study**

**Introduction**:
In the competitive landscape of the retail industry, optimizing service processes to meet customer expectations is paramount for success. This case study delves into the application of data analytics in retail to analyze customer behavior and transactional data. By merging customer, transaction, and product hierarchy datasets, we aim to derive insights that aid in strategic decision-making for the retail store.

**Dataset**:
The dataset consists of three sheets:

1. Customer: Contains customer information including demographics.
2. Transaction: Records of customer transactions.
3. Product Hierarchy: Information about product categories and sub-categories.

**Business Problem**:

The retail store aims to analyze day-to-day transactions and track customer purchases/returns across various categories. The objectives include generating summary reports, analyzing popular product categories, identifying key customer demographics, and optimizing store operations.

**Solution Approach**:

1. **Merge Datasets**: Merge customer, product hierarchy, and transaction datasets to create a comprehensive dataset named Customer_Final.
  
2. **Summary Report**:
    * Get column names and their corresponding data types.
    * Display top/bottom 10 observations.
    * Calculate the five-number summary for continuous variables.
    * Generate frequency tables for categorical variables.
      
3. **Visualization**:
   * Create histograms for continuous variables and frequency bars for categorical variables.

4. **Calculate Information**:
   * Determine the time period of available transaction data.
   * Count transactions with negative total amounts.

5. **Product Category Analysis**:
   * Analyze popular product categories among male and female customers.

6. **Customer Distribution**:
Identify the city code with the maximum customers and calculate the percentage.

7. **Store Type Analysis**:
Determine the store type selling the maximum products by value and quantity.

8. **Revenue Analysis**:
Calculate the total amount earned from specific product categories and store types.

9. **Customer Transaction Analysis**:
Identify customers with more than 10 unique transactions after removing negative transactions.

10. **Age-based Analysis**:
For customers aged between 25-35, calculate the total amount spent on specific product categories and during a specific time period.

11. **Conclusion**:
This case study demonstrates the importance of data analytics in retail for understanding customer behavior, optimizing operations, and driving profitability. By leveraging data-driven insights, retailers can make informed decisions to stay competitive in the dynamic retail landscape.
